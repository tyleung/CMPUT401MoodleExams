To setup the php unit test environment:

1. Installing Composer dependencies. It's likely been already installed but
just to make sure:
	
	sudo apt-get update
	sudo apt-get install curl php5-cli git
	
2. Install composer:
	
	curl -sS https://getcomposer.org/installer | sudo php -- --install-dir=/usr/local/bin --filename=composer
	
3. Go to the Moodle's dirroot (the main folder that has the config file, etc.)
and run:
	
	composer update
	
4. Wait a few minutes while it searches for the versions of the library
specified. After some time, it'll ask you to create a github OAuth token to go
over the API rate limit. Go to the link they give you in the terminal, and
create the token and paste that value into Token (hidden): in the terminal. It
will then display Token stored successfully. and will let you finish.

4. To initialize the PHPUnit environment, type this into the terminal:
	
	php admin/tool/phpunit/cli/init.php
	
5. You can then run the PHPUnit test by doing this in the terminal from moodle's dirroot:
	
	vendor/bin/phpunit
	
6. To run individual tests (aka: just ours), run this in the terminal from moodle's dirroot:
	
	vendor/bin/phpunit local/memplugin/tests/<filename of the unittest>.php
